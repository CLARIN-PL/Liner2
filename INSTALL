Liner2 packages requires CRF++ (http://crfpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html).
The compatible version can be also found in the ./external folder. If you do not
have installed CRF++ then run bellow command, in other case you can skip this step.

  ant crfpp-make
  sudo ant crfpp-install
  
If you already have installed CRF++ then you have to compile Java wrappers. You
can do it by executing following command:

  ant crfpp-jar
  
At this step you might encounter a problem with finding jni.h file. You have to
check a path to java-sdk, parameter INCLUDE in 'external/crfpp/java/Makefile'. 

Make sure that the files 'lib/libCRFPP.so' and 'lib/CRFPP.jar' were created.

Liner2 uses an external tool for features construction called NERD. It requires
following Python packages:
 * numpy-1.5.1.tar.gz
 * PyYAML-3.09.tar.gz
 * networkx-0.99.tar.gz
 * biopython-1.54b.tar.gz
 * setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz
 * MySQL-python-1.2.3.tar.gz
 * nltk-2.0.1rc1.tar.gz
 * Django 1.3

To check what packages are missing, please run following command:

  ./nerd/check.py

The final step is compilation of Liner2, just execute:

  ant jar
  
To check, if the configuration was successful run the following command:

  ./liner2.sh pipe -ini model-5nam-v1/model.ini -i ccl -f test/sentence.xml -o tuples
  
You should see following output:

	(4,6,PERSON_FIRST_NAM,"Ala")
	(7,11,PERSON_LAST_NAM,"Nowak")
	(20,28,CITY_NAM,"Warszawie")
