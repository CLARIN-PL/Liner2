Installation
============    
    
  Liner2 requires CRF++ (http://crfpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html).
  The compatible version can be also found in the ./external/crfpp folder. 
  If you do not have installed CRF++ then run following command, in other case 
  you can skip this step.

    ant crfpp-make
    sudo ant crfpp-install
  
  If you already have installed CRF++ then you have to compile Java wrapper. You
  can do it by executing following command:

    ant crfpp-jar
  
  At this step you might encounter a problem with finding jni.h file. You have to
  check a path to java-sdk, parameter INCLUDE in 'external/crfpp/java/Makefile'. 

  When the wrapper is compiled make sure that the files './lib/libCRFPP.so' 
  and './lib/CRFPP.jar' were created.

  Liner2 uses an external tool for feature generation called NERD included in
  the package. The NERD module requires following Python packages:
   * numpy-1.5.1.tar.gz
   * PyYAML-3.09.tar.gz
   * networkx-0.99.tar.gz
   * biopython-1.54b.tar.gz
   * setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz
   * MySQL-python-1.2.3.tar.gz
   * nltk-2.0.1rc1.tar.gz
   * Django 1.3

  To check if all required packages are installed, run the following command:

    ./nerd/check.py

  If all packages are "ok", then compile Liner2 by executing:

    ant jar

  To set a global command linked with the current installation run:

    ant install

  This will create a global command 'liner2' which allow to use current
  installation instance from any location.

Test
====    
  
  To check, if the installation was successful run the following command:

    ./liner2.sh pipe -i ccl -f test/sentence.xml -o tuples

  or using global command:

    liner2 pipe -i ccl -f PATH/test/sentence.xml -o tuples
  
  You should see following output:

	(4,6,PERSON_FIRST_NAM,"Ala")
	(7,11,PERSON_LAST_NAM,"Nowak")
	(20,28,CITY_NAM,"Warszawie")
