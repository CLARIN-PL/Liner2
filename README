COMPILING

To compile liner2, type the following commands:

ant crfpp-compile
cd external/crfpp/java
make
cd ../../..
ant crfpp-jar
ant jar

If "make" command in "external/crfpp/java/" directory is unable to find file "jni.h", change line 6 of external/crfpp/java/Makefile to:

INCLUDE=/path/to/file

Where /path/to/file is the path to "jni.h" ("include" directory of Java JDK).

RUNNING

To run, use the liner2.sh script.
