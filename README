COMPILING

=== Compilation and installation of required dependences (CRF++) ===

First, set a path to your java sdk (containing jni.h) --- INCLUDE variable in the Makefile:

  vi external/crfpp/java/Makefile
  
Next, run the following commands: 

  ant crfpp-make
  sudo ant crfpp-install
  ant crfpp-jar

  
=== Compilation ===

  ant jar  


=== Test ===

Command:

   ./liner2.sh pipe -ini model-5nam-v1/model.ini -i ccl -f test/sentence.xml -o tuples
 
Should return:

	(4,6,PERSON_FIRST_NAM,"Ala")
	(7,11,PERSON_LAST_NAM,"Nowak")
	(20,28,CITY_NAM,"Warszawie")


=== Run ===

Pipe mode:

  ./liner2.sh 

Interactive mode:


Interactive mode for raw text (requires maca):

  ./liner2.sh batch -ini model-56nam-v1/model.ini -i plain -o tuples -maca -


=== Error troubleshooting ===

If `ant crfpp-jar` command in "external/crfpp/java/" directory is unable to find file "jni.h", change line 6 of external/crfpp/java/Makefile to:

INCLUDE=/path/to/file

Where /path/to/file is the path to "jni.h" ("include" directory of Java JDK).

RUNNING

To run, use the liner2.sh script.
